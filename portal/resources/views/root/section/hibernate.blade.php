        <strong>
          After successful events in 2017, 2019, 2020, online in 2021, and back again in person in 2024,
          the current iteration of Kohoutek is taking a break, awaiting new hands to take it over once more!
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Organising the event was usually fairly straightforward with a small group of students taking on the core
        tasks, then joined by a larger group drawn from various University Scout and Guide Clubs (and normally from
        elsewhere within Scouting and Guiding too!) to develop the activity bases and come run them on the day. Usually
        it would be members from this larger group that would then go on to take over some of the core organisation for
        the following years event, passing on their knowledge to the next group of students.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the 2024 event the core team were University of Bristol alumni, taking on their roles from pre-covid events
        again in the hope that this would restart the organisation of the event by current students. At this time the
        University clubs are currently focussed on rebuilding their membership and so are unfortunately unlikely to take
        on the event for 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event has been placed in a state of hibernation, with planning documents archived and the contents of the
        bank account placed in trust, in the hope that new organisers will step forward over the next few years to take
        it on.

          If any students who are part of the University of Bristol, or University of the West of England affiliated
          Student Scout and Guide (SSAGO) clubs wish to take on the event, get in touch and we'll pass on everything we
          can (and probably lend a hand too!) - contact@kohoutek.co.uk
