# Kohoutek
Kohoutek was a competition and activity day run for Scouts and Guides, organised by students and alumni from the [University of Bristol Guides and Scouts (UOBGAS)](https://www.facebook.com/UoBGaS) society, part of the [Student Scout and Guide Organisation (SSAGO)](https://ssago.org).

*After successful events in 2017, 2019, 2020, online in 2021, and back again in person in 2024, the current iteration of Kohoutek is taking a break, awaiting new hands to take it over once more!*

This repository contains the source for the event portal, built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [UIKit](https://github.com/uikit/uikit), which groups use to sign up for the event and manage their booking. It also includes a static 'splash page' which was used in the run up to the event.
